# Introduction

Bluesky now has over 30 million users. Journalists, politicians, activists, celebrities, and everyday individuals now use it on a daily basis to engage with the content and communities that matter the most to them. At this point, many organizations, companies, and creators are asking themselves the question, “should I start using Bluesky as a communication and growth channel for my brand?”

The answer is now a confident “yes”. 

After many years of development, a successful escape from Twitter before it became X, and now explosive growth at the hands of a changing political landscape in the United States, the clouds have parted and given us a glimpse of the blue sky that lies beyond the storm that is the centralized walled gardens of legacy social media platforms.

Now is your chance to reclaim autonomy and ownership over your brand’s presence on the social web, unshackling it from the oppressive and black box algorithms that prevent people from visiting your website links or seeing your latest posts.

But how do you do that exactly? While creating a Bluesky account is a simple task, effectively using that account and integrating your brand with the existing Bluesky community can feel quite overwhelming. While it might look like any ordinary social media platform on the surface, there are many features and properties that make Bluesky vastly different. Understanding these differences fully will make the difference between success and failure.

The following is a simple playbook that you can use to help your brand easily navigate the complexities of Bluesky. We’ll cover everything from Bluesky’s culture, Discover algorithm, custom feeds, composable moderation, and much more... eventually landing at a cohesive foundational strategy that you can then build upon.

## About the author

My name is Dame, and I was Bluesky’s 1,216th user. I joined during its early days at the beginning of 2023 when you had to have an invitation. I sent the CEO of Bluesky, Jay Graber, a private message on Twitter asking if she would invite me and she graciously obliged. 

I also setup one of the very first brand accounts on Bluesky, back when that wasn’t something most people thought was worth the ROI. There weren’t many active users at the time, but the early tech adopters that predominated the community at the time was exactly the type of people our brand was trying to connect with.

Nowadays I build custom tools and resources that help people have a more enjoyable Bluesky experience. I’m definitely what most people would call “chronically online”, averaging around 9-10 posts a day and 16-20 replies to other users. I’ve seen all that Bluesky has to offer... both the good and that bad, and I know what works and doesn’t work.

My hope is that I can use the insane number of hours I spend on Bluesky to make the platform more accessible to everyone else, including brands and communities that want to connect with their audiences there.

With that being said, let’s get started.
