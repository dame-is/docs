# AT Protocol Community Resource Library
## Summary

Written by Claude, guided by Dame.

### TL;DR
We propose creating a comprehensive, community-maintained directory of AT Protocol and Bluesky resources using a set of Lexicons for `atproto.community`. The system allows users to submit resources, vote and review them, propose amendments to keep information current, and detect duplicatesâ€”all while respecting the AT Protocol's repository ownership model.

## The Problem

Currently, information about AT Protocol tools and resources is scattered across various websites that:
- Often contain advertisements
- Vary greatly in completeness and accuracy
- Lack community maintenance capabilities
- Don't utilize the AT Protocol's native capabilities

## The Solution

We propose a community-curated resource directory built on AT Protocol using custom Lexicons that enable:

1. **Resource Submission** - Anyone can submit tools, clients, feed generators, etc.
2. **Community Curation** - Voting, reviews, and collections
3. **Collaborative Maintenance** - Amendment process for updating information
4. **Duplicate Prevention** - Intelligent detection and alias linking

## Core Components

### 1. Primary Resource Record

The foundation is the `community.atproto.resource` record containing:
- Resource name, URL, and description
- Submitter and creator DIDs
- Category and status using token references
- Tags, version info, and repository links

```json
{
  "$type": "community.atproto.resource",
  "name": "Example Feed Generator",
  "uri": "https://example.com/feed",
  "submitter": "did:plc:user123",
  "creator": "did:plc:creator456",
  "description": "A feed generator for Bluesky",
  "category": "community.atproto.resource.category.feedGenerator",
  "status": "community.atproto.resource.status.active",
  "tags": ["feeds", "algorithmic"],
  "createdAt": "2025-03-01T10:15:30Z"
}
```

### 2. Community Curation Mechanisms

**Voting**
- Simple up/down votes on resources
- Aggregation of vote totals

**Reviews**
- Detailed text reviews with ratings (1-5 stars)
- Attribution to reviewer

**Collections**
- Curated lists of resources with notes
- Thematic organization (e.g., "Best Photography Feed Generators")

### 3. Amendment System

AT Protocol repositories can only be modified by their owners, so we've designed a system to enable community updates:

1. **Amendment Proposal** - A user proposes changes to a resource
2. **Community Voting** - Other users vote on the amendment
3. **Resolution** - Automatic or admin resolution based on votes
4. **Admin View Merging** - Creation of a merged canonical view

### 4. Duplicate Handling

To prevent redundant entries:

1. **URI Normalization** - Detect similar URLs (removing www, trailing slashes, etc.)
2. **Resource Aliases** - Link alternative URLs to a canonical resource
3. **Merge Requests** - Process for combining duplicate entries

## How It Works: A Real Example

The lifecycle of "Skyline," a hypothetical Bluesky client:

1. **Initial submission** by Alice with basic info
2. **Voting and reviews** from the community
3. **Amendment proposal** when the app updates and changes URL
4. **Community voting** approves the amendment
5. **Admin view creation** merges in the changes
6. **Duplicate submission detection** when another user tries to add the same app
7. **Status update** to "discontinued" when the app is eventually retired
8. **Historical collection** preserves the resource in a curated list

## Implementation Overview

The system requires:

1. **Backend Indexing**
   - Resource and amendment tracking
   - Vote tallying and resolution
   - URL normalization for duplicate detection

2. **User Experience**
   - Clear amendment and voting interfaces
   - Transparent display of merged information
   - Duplicate detection during submission

## Benefits

1. **Centralized Discovery** - One reliable place to find AT Protocol resources
2. **Community Maintained** - Accuracy through collective knowledge
3. **Structured Data** - Consistent format for all resource information
4. **Attribution** - Proper credit to creators and contributors
5. **Historical Record** - Documentation of the ecosystem's evolution

## Next Steps

1. Develop backend indexing service
2. Create frontend components
3. Establish moderation policies
4. Seed with initial resources
5. Engage with tool creators for verification
